So this is a story about my first blog and the tools used to create it.

A few months ago I decided that i want to start writing about development and other stuff running around through my head. After playing around with [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) , [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io); I decided that Hugo is the way to go for my needs. Github Pages is a nice free hosting place for small static sites, CircleCI is used for deployment and everything was up and running in a few hours with the nice Hugo-Zen theme made by Rakuishi.

Let the journey begin!
